Short Answer:
Mutexes put a thread to sleep when the lock is busy, while spinlocks 
continuously spin and consume CPU. For short critical sections, spinning 
is fast because threads do not block. But for long critical sections 
(spending time inside the lock), spinlocks waste CPU cycles and perform 
much worse than mutexes.
